            <h1 class="title">AUSTRALIAN PHYSICAL HEALTH</h1>
                <p class="introText">Physical and mental health are crucial components required to live a fulfilling and prosperous life. But are Australians
                    taking the necessary steps to ensure their health is in check? This visualisation explores the physical health of
                    Australians, aiming to uncover if Australians are doing enough.

                        A dangerous pattern can be observed via the charts on the left. <div class="smallBreak"></div>
                        Australians tend to overestimate their health - despite nearly 22% of Australians being unhealthy,
                        only 15% of them correctly identified this. <div class="smallBreak"></div>
                        Perhaps more concerningly, nearly 57% of Australians reported themselves as healthy, when in reality only
                        41.5% of Australians fall into this category. <div class="breakDiv"></div>
                        A reflection of this can be seen in the diseases Australians are diagnosed with.  <div class="smallBreak"></div>
                        Year on year more and more Australians are diagnosed with physical and mental diseases, a worrying
                        statistic for all Australians.

                    <span class="secondContextText">These Australian statistics show a concerning trend, and offer insight as to why Australian health levels appear to be worsening.
                        It is evident that as Australians enter adulthood, they fail to meet health guidelines more and more often. With that, there appears to be an association with
                        the increase in diseases diagnosed in Australians. <br></br>
                        The evidence does not suggest that there is any significant difference between states, though Victoria, New South Wales and the Northern Territory are the states
                        and territories in which over 50% of the population does not suffer from any long-term conditions.

                            Australians are spending far more time performing sedentary behaviours than they are on active behaviours. <div class="smallBreak"></div>
                            This trend laregely follows age, as the older Australians get, the less time they spend on active behaviours. <div class="smallBreak"></div>
                            <div class="breakDiv"></div> <div class="smallBreak"></div>
                            This is further reflected in the participation rates of Australians in sporting activities. <div class="smallBreak"></div>
                            Younger age groups are more likely to participate, which seems to correlate to whether or not they are sufficiently active. <div class="smallBreak"></div>
